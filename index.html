                Becoming officially an Eng I was a great feeling but one that I did not had enough time to realize since we were in the middle of our new report implementation and release. During this time I learnt how BE/FE work hand on hand and how important it is to always take into account both when taking product decisions. During this time I developed my first solo features. I drove initiatives from design all the way through FE to BE. I had back and forwards with product and design to develop mvps that we were able to deliver, validate and improve to its final stages. My role was as a full stack but with a heavy focus on FE since at the time we were short of FE engs and I was willing to help the team accomplish our goals. Once again I found myself growing and learning from great engineers at our team and other teams as well.

                <p><strong>Associate Engineer</strong><br>
                After our intensive academy EDA instructors and mentors matched each one of us with the most suitable team at the company. I hit the jackpot! I got to work on distribution blue. This team was in charge of integrations with partners in particular with Facebook. I got to work along with 4 other engs and I learned so much and so freaking fast! I was very lucky with the teammates I had the pleasure to share those initial months. During that time I migrated some of our monolith actions into our own service in python, I fixed many bugs involving legacy technologies like mako or backbone all the way up to React. I had my first cross company meetings with facebook engineers where we had to fix integration issues or keep up with tight api upgrades on their side.
                Pandemic had some impact on our teams structure and I was relocated to the team I am currently part of the Kangaroos.
                Is it possible to hit the jackpot again? Well I did! Kangaroos has been the best team of people I have ever worked with. At the time I joined the team was under construction putting 6 engs from other teams to take the reins of one of the key features at the platform Reporting. During this time I got to work on our redesigned BE/FE framework for reporting, helping to shape our requirements for our new report and implementing my first components on React.

                CMP was a company that provided construction services for mining. The project took place south of City of Mendoza at Malargüe. It was a multimillionaire project to install and provide all the piping and facilities required to extract and exploit potassium. CMP was in charge of the construction of the civil buildings for the people that was going to operate the mine. <br>
                This was mi first job experience as a Civil Engineer and a very challenging one. I was the Project's Manager assistant and I participated in quality assessment for the construction process.
